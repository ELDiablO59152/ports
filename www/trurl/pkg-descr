trurl parses, manipulates and outputs URLs and parts of URLs.

It uses the RFC 3986 definition of URLs and it uses libcurl's URL
parser to do so, which includes a few "extensions". The URL support is
limited to "hierarchical" URLs, the ones that use "://" separators
after the scheme.

Typically you pass in one or more URLs and decide what of that you want
output. Posssibly modifying the URL as well.

trurl knows URLs and every URL consists of up to ten separate and
independent "components". These components can be extracted, removed
and updated with trurl and they are referred to by their respective
names: scheme, user, password, options, host, port, path, query,
fragment and zoneid.
